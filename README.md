# CSC-330-MidTermDTALL
Midterm project for CSC 330, based on Option 3 of creating a flask application that lists facts for animals.
The project lists 5 facts for dogs, cats, and elephants. It uses dynamic routes in flask to display each different animal through a HTML template. The facts are stored in a list within a dictionary that corresponds to each animal, and get passed to the HTML file.
